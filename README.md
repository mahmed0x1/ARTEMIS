ARTEMIS is the first framework to embed smart-contract-driven policy enforcement directly into diffusion model training, ensuring copyright compliance through blockchain-verified governance.

## Key Features

- üñºÔ∏è **In-Loop Concept Erasure**: Null-space projection removes prohibited concepts during training
- üîó **Blockchain-Verified Compliance**: Polygon smart contracts track policy enforcement
- üîí **zk-SNARK Proofs**: Cryptographic proofs of compliance without revealing model details
- ‚ö° **Layer-2 Efficiency**: Optimistic rollups aggregate proofs for scalability
